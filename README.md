# 📊 Continental Dashboard  
*John Wick Themed React + TypeScript dashboard for guest engagement analytics*

I did this assignment with mock data themed after John Wick. Names/details of many "guests" have been generated by AI to create an artificially larger data set. I did this to have a bit of fun with the assignment. My brain thrives on context and I decided to go the mock route to work with data that seemed fun and playful while still working in a way to mirror the assignment’s functional requirements.

### Things I enjoyed
I really enjoyed setting up the component relationships. I have worked with quite a few components with interdependencies (like subcomponents) and I wanted to touch on that. This is why there is a Guest List and a Hotel List.

### Things I struggled with
My netlify deploy gave me a bit of fuss, so I may not have a live demo to show, which was my intention. Short on time, I pointed my attention to the building of things rather than the deloying of things server-side.

### What I'd keep working on
I'd keep building out the styling architecture utilize global standards in a centrally controlled way while also keeping the core stylesheet lean and working with CSS modules for individual components. The file structure reflects this intent and that's where I'd keep moving things.

**Recharts interactivity**: I would explore extending the filter controls functions to clicking the Recharts visualization.

## 🚀 Quick Start  
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run test
```

## 🛠 Implementation  
### Data Flow  
- **API Mocking**: `fetchGuests()` in `/src/api/`
- **Filters**: Multi-select by status (tested in `GuestList.test.tsx`)  
- **Chart**: Recharts

### Styling  
- **SCSS Architecture**:  
  ```
  styles/
  ├── main.scss          # Central import  
  ├── _{filenames}.scss  # Style rules
  ```  

I anticipated wanting to move toward using CSS Modules for compoents, which is why component-specific styles live where they do.

**CSS Strategy:** I defaulted to SCSS for this project due to its rapid development cycle and my deep familiarity with its toolchain. While this allowed for quick iteration, in a production environment I would:

1. Assess Team Needs - Evaluate whether CSS Modules or a utility-first approach better aligns with team expertise
2. Benchmark Performance - Compare bundle size impacts between approaches
3. Maintainability thresholds

The choice intentionally prioritized shipping over perfection, while creating a codebase that could be incrementally migrated to other systems as needed. 

### Testing
Written in Jest `/src/components/GustList/GuestList.test.tsx`

## GuestList Component  
```tsx
<GuestList />
```  

**Purpose**: Displays and filters all Continental guests with their statuses and affiliations  

### Core Features  
- 🔍 **Multi-Filter System**:  
  ```ts
  type FilterType = 'all' | 'active' | 'excommunicado' | 'pending' | 'deceased' | 'retired'
  ```  
  - Toggle multiple filters simultaneously  
  - Clear all filters with one click

- 🏷️ **Guest Status Tracking**:  
  - Priority-sorted status badges (`GuestStatusBadge`)  
  - Visual indicators for:  
    - Unpaid markers (severity levels)  
    - Active bounties  
    - Excommunicado status

- 🏨 **Hotel Affiliation**:  
  - Shows current Continental hotel for each guest  
  - "No affiliation" state for unregistered guests  

### Technical Implementation  
- 📡 **Data Handling**:  
  - Fetches guests and hotels via `useMockApi`  
  - Sorts guests by status priority:  
    ```ts
    ['Active', 'Pending', 'Retired', 'Revoked', 'Excommunicado', 'Deceased']
    ```  

- ⚙️ **Filter Logic**:  
  - Uses `useEffect` dependencies for efficient re-filtering  
  - Maintains filter state while avoiding unnecessary re-renders  

- 🛡️ **Error States**:  
  - Handles API failures with themed error messages  
  - Loading state with Continental-themed UI  

### UI/UX Elements  
- Filter tags show active selections  
- Responsive layout  
- Visual hierarchy for critical information (bounties/markers)  
- Empty state when no filters match  

## HotelList Component  
```tsx
<HotelList />
```

**Purpose**: Displays all Continental Hotels with their current guests and statuses 

### Key Features  
- 📡 **Data Fetching**:  
  - Uses `useMockApi` to fetch hotels and guests data  
  - Handles loading/error states

- 🏨 **Hotel Display**:  
  - Shows hotel details (name, location, manager)  
  - Visual status badges (`GuestStatusBadge`)  
  - Lists house rules for each location  

- 🕴️ **Guest Management**:  
  - Filters and sorts guests by status priority:  
    ```ts
    ['Excommunicado', 'Revoked', 'Deceased', 'Active', 'Retired']
    ```  
  - Displays guest details with `GuestStatusBadge` components  
  - Highlights unpaid markers (red badge)
